# Hosting Anime Radio Club as your own bot:
## Dependencies
These are the stuff you'll have to install before doing anything

* FFMPEG (just google how to install ffmpeg for node js or something)
* `discord.js`, if it wasn't obvious enough
* `request`
* `sqlite`, for per-guild prefixes (could also use my code to learn how to do per-guild config if you wanted to :D)
* `node-opus` or `opusscript`, either one or else you'll get an error about the opus engine being missing
